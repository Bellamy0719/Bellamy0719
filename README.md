## 📈 Data Science & AI Direction

Building on my analytical foundation, I am transitioning toward **ML & AI systems engineering**:  
- Integrating ML models into production-ready pipelines (with MLflow / SageMaker)  
- Exploring **Transformer architectures, LLM-based pipelines**, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
- Bridging **data engineering, machine learning, and AI applications** end-to-end

---

## 🧠 Current Goals
- Develop a dbt-based transformation layer with modular, testable data models  
- Implement MLflow for tracking, deployment, and monitoring  
- Build an AI-ready data foundation for advanced analytics and intelligent automation
